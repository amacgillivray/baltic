Thomas looked at the valley. The pit of it was crystal blue water, shimmering beneath the summer sun. Then, around it, soft green prarie grass, which slowly gave way to the dark evergreen forest as the altitude rose. The tree line then starts to break, interrupted by deep gray and brown of the rock face, then grass and rock replaced the trees, and finally, white snow – stubbornly present in the height of the summer – capped the peaks. 

“They don’t know what they’re missing out on,” Luke said, admiring the scene. 

“In the old days,” Thomas said, “views like this cost a million bucks.” Thomas was the oldest of the group, at 45. 

“I had only seen pictures.”
